## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
- On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the Flask server:
```bash
python server.py
```
The server should start on http://localhost:5000 by default.


### 3. Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
or if you use yarn:
```bash
yarn
```
Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
or with yarn:
```bash
yarn dev
```
The Vite development server should start on http://localhost:5173 by default.

## Development
To work on this project, you'll need to run both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously.

Start the backend server in one terminal following the backend setup instructions.
Start the frontend development server in another terminal following the frontend setup instructions.
